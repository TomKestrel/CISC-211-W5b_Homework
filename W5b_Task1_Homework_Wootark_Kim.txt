; Task 1: Generate a counter using an EBX register, debug, and explain your findings. 
; Use the code written in the  counter (optimized version) example.

; the section where my code that will be read begins
section .text
        global _start

_start:
        mov ebx,10  	;ebx is a counter register this time (instead of ecx)
	mov eax, 0	;setting eax to 0

label:
        inc eax		;eax will keep increasing as long as ebx keeps looping decrementally
        dec ebx		;will keep looping until ebx reaches 0
	jnz label	;keep looping by jumping to the beginning of this code if ebx is not zero

	; instructions for shutting down
	mov eax, 1		;load eax with the system call number 1 (prepare to shut down)
	int 0x80		;instruction to make the system call

; Explaining my debug findings:
; As I ran the assembler, I found that the eax register did visually go up while the ebx, acting as the counter, did go down.
; I also noticed the ZF flag come up once hte ebx counter hit 0. From what I understand, when using the jnz label, the assembler will
; automatically know which register is relevant. In this case it is ebx because "dec ebx" means it will eventually reach zero and the 
; jnz will look for a ZF flag (which "dec ebx" will trigger once it hits zero).
