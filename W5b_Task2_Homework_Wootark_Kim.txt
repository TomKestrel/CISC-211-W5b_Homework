; Task 2: Calculate the final number of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers starting from 0. The result should be equal to 55
; Answer confirmed with gdb: eax value displayed as 55 for the 10th Fibonacci number

_start:

	mov ebx, 1       	; F(1), the 2nd initial value
	mov ecx, 9       	; Counter set to 9 (which means 9 loops total)

    	add eax, ebx      	; Compute the next Fibonacci number
	mov edx, eax		; swapping eax and ebx since eax is now the new fibonacci number and ebx will be the previous number
